# Python-Gurobi-Staff-Assingment-Optimization
This project is my practice on operations research where I use Gurobi solver on Python environment to optimize the staff assignment for a factory

Given a factory with below information:
- The factory produces 7 days a week with 3 shifts a day - morning, afternoon and evening
- The factory already planned for the demand next week and estimated the required workforce as below: Monday (6,4,3), Tuesday (5,5,5), Wednesday (6,4,4), Thurday (5,5,5), Friday (5,5,3), Saturday (6,5,4) and Sunday (5,5,4)
- The total workforce that the factory has is 20 people. According to the labor force rights, a labor can only work 1 shift a day and each week, a labor must take leave at least 2 days
- So, us, as a production planner, how can we assign each labor to each day and each shift to minimize the cost, satisfy the demand but still follow the rights?
